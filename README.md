## ❓ FAQ

### **Do I need a visa for Vietnam?**
Yes, most visitors to Vietnam need an e-visa. The e-visa costs around ₹2,200 and can be obtained online through the official Vietnam Immigration website. Processing typically takes 3-5 business days. Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates.

### **What currency should I carry?**
The local currency is Vietnamese Dong (VND). While major hotels and restaurants accept cards, it's best to carry cash for street food, markets, and smaller shops. ATMs are widely available in cities. Exchange some money upon arrival at the airport for initial expenses.

### **How is the weather in Vietnam in August/September?**
August-September is warm and humid throughout Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh City and Phu Quoc may experience occasional rain showers. Da Nang will be hot and sunny. Pack light, breathable clothing, swimwear, a light rain jacket, sunscreen, and a hat.

### **What are the best local foods to try?**
Don't miss trying pho (noodle soup), banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), fresh spring rolls, bun cha (grilled pork with noodles), and Vietnamese coffee. Each region has its specialties: try hu tieu in HCMC, seafood in Phu Quoc, and Mi Quang noodles in Da Nang.

### **How reliable is public transportation?**
Within cities, Grab is convenient and affordable. For longer distances, domestic flights are efficient but book early. The night bus to Rach Gia is comfortable with reclining seats, and the Superdong ferry to Phu Quoc is reliable but can be affected by weather conditions during monsoon season.
